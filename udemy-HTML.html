      <h1>Pangolin</h1>

      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>
        Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order
        Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). The one extant
        family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis
        comprises the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia
        include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species
        range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct
        pangolin species are also known.
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin;
        they are the only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow
        trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and
        their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture
        using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only
        to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise
        for about two years.
      </p>
      <h2>Poaching</h2>
      <p>
        Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which
        are used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of
        their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the
        world.As of January 2020, of the eight species of pangolin, three (Manis
        culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically
        endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia
        gigantea) are listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and
        Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of
        Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of
        Nature.
